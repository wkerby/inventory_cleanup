## **inventory_cleanup**
Use pandas package to standardize and retrieve missing pieces of data for paper records storage boxes for Brasfield & Gorrie, L.L.C for those who coordinate box destruction in compliance with records retention policies. Originally, there were discrepancies between our own internal data and that of VRC (our third-party records storage partner). For example, as it pertains to our internally-managed data, several records contained no date of admission into warehouse or a date of destruction. The first step involves export of VRC's data into .xslx file. Next, pass both internal data and VRC data into respective data frames and, using box barcode as unique ID, retrieve any missing pieces  of data for each box record. Lastly, some box records were allocated to multiple business owners, and each business owner was assigned to more than one box. To solve this issue, generate join_IDs and write join_ID table to .csv file.
